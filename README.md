Break your users from unethical tracking networks. xz/fonts delivers exclusively open-source fonts through [Vercel](https://vercel.com)'s impossibly fast CDN. 

Want to see for yourself? Watch how fast fonts render on [this page](https://fonts.xz.style/font-speed.html).

For the font Inter, it's as easy as adding this to your CSS:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.xz.style/serve/inter.css');
```

or this to your HTML's `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.xz.style/serve/inter.css">
```

## Usage
